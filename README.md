# WORDLE ROBOT

This Python program is able to solve the [WORDLE](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) challenge. ðŸ˜ƒ

The story started with a fun.  Then, with `Letter Frequency` idea of â€‹â€‹how often each word has repetitive letters and  `Word Frequency` idea of â€‹â€‹how much the word itself repeats in English and with `Position Frequency` idea of â€‹â€‹what rank the letters have in each position, we were able to design a feedback analysis and word selection section. Finally, build the WordleRobot.

## Recommended Python Version:

## Setup
Just run WordleRobot.py from your python:
```bash
python3 wordleRobot.py

Hey! Calm Down, I am here to solve wordle chalnge(*_*).
==========
Just give me a feedback like:
=> * : The letter X is in the word and in the correct spot.
=> # : The letter X is in the word but in the wrong spot.
=> - : The letter X is not in the word in any spot.
==========

```
